### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matthew Tritico.
I am currently working at [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) as a Staff Software Engineer on the Platform Architecture team.

- I am a software engineer that has held positions as technical architect, principal engineer, technical project manager and executive director. I have over 20 years of software development experience, across a variety of languages and platforms, and almost 10 years of hands-on AWS practice, including certifications.

- I am an avid supporter of the New Orleans tech community. For 8 consecutive years, I organized the popular [BarCampNola](http://barcampnola.com/) conference and engaged in numerous other community activities and speaking engagements.

- I spoke at SXSW Interactive in 2009 and returned in 2010 to organize a panel representing the efforts of our Nola Tech community.

- In 2016, I traveled and worked remotely across 12 different countries over 12 months as a member of the [2nd class of Remote Year](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*u6ccBJAQGfCJ6ILCQ0u9oA.png).
